Hi, this is my 100 day journey of learning python during the spring of 2024, 
  Each day depicts a different project I have completed which ranges from a blog site, inventory management system, basic websites,
  login systems, utilizing databases, API's , and many more.
  
  For this I used Replit's free Python course, so if anything doesn't show / work feel free to double check on my replit account below.
